# EventHub - Event Management System

EventHub is a robust Event Management System developed as part of our final-year group project. The system is designed to simplify campus event planning, registration, and ticket booking. As the UI architect, I focused on incorporating modern design principles to deliver a seamless user experience. We developed this system using the MERN stack (MySQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and adhered to agile Scrum methodology for efficient project management.
